# PyBer Analysis
## Project Overview
   This project analyzed the difference in the utilization of ride sharing services based three city types (urban, suburban and rural). Given two datasets containing four months of rideshare data, a summary table and a multiple-line chart was created to show the relationships between the type of city, number of riders, number of drivers and fares. The analysis will be used to help improve access to ride sharing services and affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results
### Summary of Rideshare Data 


**Data from January to early May of 2019**

### Pyber Data Analysis for each City Types 
- The Urban neighborhoods had:
  - the highest number of rides and drivers 
  - the lowest average fare per ride and driver. 
- The Rural neighborhoods had: 
  - the least total rides and drivers 
  - the highest average fare per ride and driver 
- The Suburban neighborhoods’ total number of rides and drivers and the average fares per ride and driver were in between the Urban and Rural neighborhoods.  

### Weekly Total Fares for each City Types
   -  The rural neighborhoods’ weekly total fares were the lowest amongst all city types.
   -  The urban neighborhoods’ weekly total fares were the highest amongst all city types.
   -  Each city types had its lowest weekly total fares in January.      
   - Weekly total fares increased in the 3rd week of February and decreased in the 1st week of March.
   - The weekly total fares in the 1st week of January increased compared to the 4th week of April 2019. 

   - **The highest weekly total fares:** 
       - Urban neighborhoods – 2nd week of March
       - Suburban neighborhoods - 4th week of February
       - Rural neighborhoods - 1st week of April  
   - **The lowest weekly total fares:** 
       - Urban neighborhoods - 1st week of January
       - Suburban neighborhoods - 1st week of January
       - Rural neighborhoods – 2nd second week of January  
  - **The weekly total fares range:** 
       - Urban neighborhoods: $1,600 - $2500
       - Rural neighborhoods: $700 - $1400
       - Rural neighborhoods: $50 - $500
            
## Summary

- The results of the fare analysis showed that there were significant disparities between city types’ total fares, rides, drivers and average fare per ride and driver. To close the gap between the total fares, a pricing system that will evenly distribute the base pricing should be developed. The base pricing calculation will be based on historical ride share data for all city types. Essentially, areas with a higher demand for rides will subsidize the areas with a lower demand. This aims to address the ride share accessibility to under-served communities.

- A seasonal fare adjustment based on usage could be implemented. The results show that the demand for rides increased in February and the first week of March. The weather could be one of the contributing factors for increase in demand for rides. Generally, during cold seasons if given a choice most people would rather take a car ride than walk to their destination. Seasonal changes could be a factor to consider determining price.   

- Pricing based on time and day of the week could be implemented for city and suburban city types. The price per ride will be adjusted based on the day and time of the week. Implementing this adjustment to urban and suburban city types could help address the fare disparities between city types.
